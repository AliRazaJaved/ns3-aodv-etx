# ns3-aodv-etx
This project implements ETX metrix in AODV routing protocol in NS3 simulator.
Project is still in development phase. Expected to be finalized in november 2017.

This implementation is based on NS-3.26.
To try how it works reader shuld delete all files from aodv folder in ns-3.26 instalation (folder "/ns-3.26/src/aodv"). Then copy all files from aodv folder from this repository to aodv folder in your ns-3.26 instalaltion.
Testing example: Copy file "/scratch/ideal-8node-floor-v01-00.cc" from this repository to your ns-3.26 folder "/ns-3.26/scratch". Change directory to "/ns-3.26" and enter command "./waf --run ideal-8node-floor-v01-00" to run this example.
